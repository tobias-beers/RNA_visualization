## Code of the project

This folder contains the code used for this project. The most important work was done using PyStan and can be found in './PyStan'.

We also tried working with TensorFlow Probabilities (TFP) at first, but we discontinued doing that. The TFP related files can still be found in './TensorFlow'.

All data used in the experiments can be found in its original format in './DataSets'.

The './Python' directory contains some misceleanious pieces of code programmed in Python.
